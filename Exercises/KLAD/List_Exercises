1) Consider the out_top1000.csv list of most popular names per year since 1880 (the file can be pulled from our repository). Make a plot of the number of people born with the names 'Bill', 'George', 'Hillary' and 'Michele'.  

Why is it impossible to plot the number of people with the name of 'Barack' using this top1000 list?

---
Solution:
import pandas as pd
top1000 = pd.read_csv('out_top1000.csv')
total_births_names = top1000.pivot_table('births', index='year', columns='name', aggfunc = sum )
subset = total_births_names[['Bill', 'George', 'Hillary', 'Michele']]
subset.plot(subplots=True, figsize=(12,10), grid=False, title="Number per year")
---

---
subset2 = total_births_names[['Donald', 'Barack']]
KeyError: "['Barack'] not in index"
---

2) Measure the increase in naming diversity. This can be simply done by making the sum of the weight of the 1000 (or as many as available) most popular names and by plotting them. The amount covered by the highest popular names will go down, which indicates upon an increase in diversity. (Tip: use pivot_table as well as the 'aggfunc' 'sum' over the propensities to come to the results per sex).

---
Solution:
table = top1000.pivot_table('prop', index='year', columns='sex', aggfunc=sum)
table.plot(title='Sum of table1000.prop by year and sex', yticks=np.linspace(0, 1.2, 13), xticks=range(1880, 2020, 10))
