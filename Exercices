1) Consider the out_top1000.csv list of most popular names per year since 1880 (the file can be pulled from our repository). Make a plot of the number of people born with the names 'Bill', 'George', 'Hillary' and 'Michele'.  

Why is it impossible to plot the number of people with the name of 'Barack' using this top1000 list?

Solution:
total_births_names = top1000.pivot_table('births', index='year', columns='name', aggfunc = sum )
subset = total_births_names[['Bill', 'George', 'Hillary', 'Michele']]
subset.plot(subplots=True, figsize=(12,10), grid=False, title="Number per year")

2) Measure the increase in naming diversity. This can be simply done by making the sum of the weight of the 1000 (or as many as available) most popular names and by plotting them.

---
Solution:
table = top1000.pivot_table('prop', index='year', columns='sex', aggfunc=sum)
table.plot(title='Sum of table1000.prop by year and sex', yticks=np.linspace(0, 1.2, 13), xticks=range(1880, 2020, 10))
